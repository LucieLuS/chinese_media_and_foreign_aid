# Think about future direction:

  - look at the sentiments for news articles covering existing Chinese aid programs
  - use the salience of countries in Xinhua's news articles to predict aid allocation in the upcoming years (win!)

# Data analysis plan

  - Hypothesis: Chinese government suppresses news coverage over where they give aids. 
  - Potential explanation: aids are not so popular among Chinese publics; maybe safer to keep it secret rather than promote it. 
  - Conventional studies: more coverage -- > higher salience -- > justification of more aids to the recipient countries from the perspectives of aid-giving developed democratic countries;
  - China may be an odd case. So we want to loo at whether Chinese aid allocaion can predict a drop in the media coverage in the subsequent years. More aids -- > less coverage


# Routes we can take
- Look at summary statistics of average countries mentioned so we have a baseline of media coverage across aid-recipient countries
- Try a bunch of prediction models to increase the accuracy
- Think about other predictors we can put in X (more leeways in doing predictions)
- A research design that speaks more directly to our theory
