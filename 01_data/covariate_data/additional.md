**State Fragility Index (cspf_sfi)**: 
A country’s fragility is closely associated with its state capacity to manage conflict; make and implement public policy; 
and deliver essential services and its systemic resilience in maintaining system coherence, cohesion, and quality of life; responding effectively to challenges and crises, 
and sustaining progressive development. State Fragility = Effectiveness Score + Legitimacy Score (25 points possible).

operates with openness and transparency.
