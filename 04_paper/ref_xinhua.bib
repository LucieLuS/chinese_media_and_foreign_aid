Within 12 months it generated nearly 2 million search results on Google in 0.52 seconds and was beginning to solidify into a deep historical truth. Stories can contain truths and falsehoods. Human emotions, including negativity bias, prime us to think in certain ways. This paper retells a series of stories about China's international involvement, including in Angola, Djibouti, Sri Lanka and Venezuela, that challenge the media's spin. It concludes with some suggestions about the relationship between academia and the media and policy worlds, and the need for scholars to speak `truth' to `power'.},

The article focuses on how to theorize about the success and failure of efforts by the U.S. government to promote favorable framing of its policies in foreign news media.The success of these efforts, termed ``mediated U.S. public diplomacy,'' depends most importantly on political cultural congruency between the United States and the targeted nation, as well as on the strategy, power, and motivations of foreign elites to promote positive news of the United States in their own media. The article explores the difficulties faced and the (less numerous) opportunities enjoyed by the U.S. President and administration to attain their objectives. The model proposed is generalizable to other countries' efforts to engage in mediated public diplomacy as well.},

  abstract = {How does the changing landscape of foreign aid donors and recipients affect perceptions of international status and prestige? In this paper, we build on the ``superior'' donor and ``inferior'' recipient narrative to argue that foreign aid provision is status-conferring in an aid-for-policy concessions framework. Foreign aid acceptance is status-denying, as recipients are viewed as surrendering foreign policy sovereignty in exchange for aid. Therefore, changes in aid behavior, what we term ``role reversals,'' should impact the place of new donors and new recipients in the international hierarchy. We take advantage of the recent COVID-19 crisis and the disruption of typical aid flows to field an online information experiment in the United States. Delineating psychological and strategic approaches to status, along with an original measure of comparative status, we find that foreign aid acceptance affects respondents' intrinsic, but not instrumental, status rankings. Additionally, while there are nominal status gains for new donors, the comparative \textemdash{} ordinal \textemdash{} rankings of international hierarchy remains preserved. From a positional perspective, new-found donor roles do little to change international standing, while new-found recipient roles have a negative effect on status. Consistent with the psychology literature, respondents assimilate evidence to fit within their existing views by making adjustments to the broader landscape of hierarchy outside of the bilateral aid transaction.},

By comparing 32,456 respondents interviewed just before or just after the first day of each visit, we show that visiting leaders can increase public approval among foreign citizens. The effects do not fade away immediately and are particularly large when public-diplomacy activities are reported by the news media. In most cases, military capability differentials between visiting and host countries do not appear to confer an advantage in the influence of public diplomacy.

We base our theoretical arguments on the political communication literature, but extend them to consider transnational dynamics in international relations. Specifically, we argue that U.S. leaders' credibility in the eyes of foreign publics is critical in shaping attitudes toward U.S. foreign policy. Empirically, we show that the effects of such visits were initially significantly large and positive, but weakened once the war in Iraq began and international media started reporting negative aspects of the ``war on terror.'' Most interestingly, we find some evidence that high-level visits eventually exhibited a backlash effect.},

Instead of success and prosperity, producers of gold, oil, rubber, sugar, and other commodities--many in the least developed parts of Africa and Asia--often remain mired in poverty and plagued by economic mismanagement, political authoritarianism, foreign exploitation, and violent conflict. These difficulties and the many challenges they pose for American foreign policy are the focus of this important new book. Marcus Noland and Cullen S. Hendrix review recent developments as poor countries struggle to avoid the "resource curse" but fall too often into that trap. They call for support for international efforts to encourage greater transparency and improved management of natural resource wealth and for new partnerships between the West and the developing world to "confront the curse."},

Power transition theory highlights the potential for a dissatisfied rising power to challenge the existing international order, but it is difficult to evaluate whether a rising power is dissatisfied. Where Chinese leaders choose to travel can offer insights into whether China's behavior is more consistent with that of a revisionist or status quo state and into China's broader diplomatic priorities. We present a series of expectations concerning how the travel patterns of a challenger state are likely to differ from the travel patterns of a status quo state. Using a newly compiled data set, we then analyze the correlates of travel abroad by top Chinese leaders from 1998 to 2008. Our results are more consistent with a status quo conceptualization of China, though there are some important exceptions such as willingness to travel to rogue states. We also use travel data to test other hypotheses about Chinese foreign policy behavior.},

The results indicate that while the relationship between public relations counsel and media coverage was minimal at the level of object and substantive attribute salience, noteworthy linkages were observed with affective attribute salience. In general, public relations counsel was associated with a decrease in the amount of negative news coverage. At the level of individual news stories, it was connected to increased positive valence in media content. For the dimensions of news coverage associated with public relations, media salience was related to public salience and attitudes regarding foreign nations. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

A foreign power visits an incumbent in order to reap a future policy concession; the visit is only worth the effort if the incumbent remains in power long enough to deliver on the deal. A diplomatic visit thus provides a visible and credible signal of the visitor's high confidence in the incumbent's stability in office. Domestic opponents, facing incomplete information as to the incumbent's strength, observe the signal and are deterred from mounting a challenge. Using data on U.S. diplomatic visits from 1960 to 2013, we find strong empirical support for our predictions: A visit with the U.S. president substantially reduces the risk of a leader's removal from office.},

These signals are sent by a leader personally and publicly, so that the leader becomes associated with the signal in the eyes of the public. Leader-specific signals can be a valuable tool for achieving credible extended deterrence because they are flexible, and they create personal audience and reputational costs for leaders. I focus on leader visits abroad as the type of leader-specific signal that is most likely to be credible. I use original data recording leadership visits in a statistical analysis of extended deterrence success 1950\textendash 2007 and find that these visits have a significant deterrent effect. This is particularly true when a visit is accompanied by a high level of supportive statements and when the visit recipient also has a major power defense pact.},

The success of the actors in promoting their agenda and frames in the U.S. and British news media is analyzed, revealing a complex media arena that includes the antagonists, foreign governments, and the media themselves as actors, each trying to promote its own agenda and frames. Cultural and political congruence between a foreign country and an adversary gives that antagonist an advantage over its rival actor. However, the antagonist actor still has to compete with the agenda and frames of foreign governments and media organizations.},

It analyzes international frame building, the process of creating or changing media frames in the international communications arena, by applying it to the case of Israeli mediated public diplomacy efforts during the war in Gaza in the winter of 2008\textendash 2009. The article claims that one way to use the homophily thesis in empirical analyses of international frame-building campaigns in conflicts is to measure the political and value proximity of a country promoting frames to other countries. Yet, proximity should be measured relatively rather than in absolute terms. Therefore, one should look not only at the dyadic proximity between two actors (i.e., Country A that attempts to promote its frames to Country C), but at the relative proximity between Countries A and C considering the proximity between the rival Country B and the target Country C. The study proposes a model and a method to facilitate empirical analysis of this claim. Using sophisticated computerized content analysis, our analyses demonstrate that relative proximity is related to successful international frame building in the hypothesized direction: The closer the relative proximity between Israel and a foreign country, the greater the acceptance of Israel's views.},

Using six country-level measures of affinity for China, we find that state-owned and globally diversified firms appear to conform most closely to official guidance. Official investment directives and state visits link investments to state policies; Taiwan recognition and Dalai Lama meetings anchor our political interpretations; and UN General Assembly voting and temporary UN Security Council membership suggest that this intervention may be systematic. The results are robust to country, year, and sector fixed effects, and most do not hold for private or small firms. The results suggest that China uses FDI by prominent state-owned enterprises as an instrument to promote its foreign policy.},

We provide details on 1,511 projects to fifty African countries. We use this database to extend previous research on aid and conflict, which suffers from omitted-variable bias due to the exclusion of Chinese development finance. Our results show that sudden withdrawals of ?traditional? aid no longer induce conflict in the presence of sufficient alternative funding from China.

Existing research has studied Chinese efforts to earn status from foreign governments and to direct public diplomacy toward foreign publics, but largely overlooked the country's preoccupation with foreign media. This project extends the study of China's image management by explaining variation in leading print newspapers' reporting on China. Specifically, it tests the effectiveness of two mechanisms by which China has attempted to influence foreign perceptions of itself: Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure lending and the purchase of media companies. I find that infrastructure lending does drive reporting on this form of engagement but is less effective at leading newspapers to moderate their coverage of human rights issues in China. Chinese ownership, however, does lead to a reduction in reporting on such issues. These findings suggest that China is capable of shaping narratives about itself in foreign media through material means.},

We add nuance to the picture and present a different perspective where China actively promotes its agenda among UNSC members. Using newly collected data from 2000 to 2020, we show that when Chinese leaders visit Africa, they are three times more likely to visit a sitting UNSC member country than a nonmember country.
